            <h2>Racing Rules</h2>
            <p>Our championship series aspires to realism. Players are expected to use the cockpit view. <strong>All driving aids are disabled</strong>, except auto-clutch for those who do not have a clutch pedal.</p>
            <p>A single pit stop with tire change will be mandatory (in supported series). Refueling is permitted, but not required. Whilst in the pit lane, there is a 50km/h speed limit and as a reminder, the <strong>pit limiter function is manual</strong>.</p>
            <p>Drivers are expected to stay within the confines of the track. Any driver found repeatedly cutting, to gain an advantage, will be subject to a penalty assessed by the stewards. Any penalties issued by the server during the race, are to be served by the driver within the allotted time.</p>
            <p>Most of the responsibility for avoiding incidents rests on the trailing driver. Please be patient and wait for the right moment before attempting an overtake. Give yourself a buffer space with other drivers, so you have time to react if they do something unexpected or brake early. Especially in the first corner.</p>
            <p>At the start of the race, each driver is expected to stay in their lane until a single file racing order has been established. When no amount of overlap remains between cars, the trailing car is expected to observe single file order and tuck in behind the leading car while entering the next corner, even if this is prior to the first corner. Overtaking is permitted (when a driver has a bad start for example), but exercise caution approaching turn 1 and respect other driver lanes.</p>
            <p>Overtaking is to be done when it is safe to do so. Drivers are permitted to defend by changing position only once per straight, and must be done so safely, so as to not be considered blocking.</p>
            <p>A driver attempting an overtake while entering the braking zone (so as to not be considered dive bombing), must have gained overlap of <strong>at least their front tires</strong> against the lead car to be considered as "side by side" by stewards in the event of an incident. Lead cars should assume that trailing drivers have gained overlap as soon as the in game spotter has notified them of the car beside. Once overlap has been established both drivers are expected to respect the other drivers lane until no overlap remains and the spotter for the lead car notifies you are clear.</p>
            <p>Re-entering the track after an incident, must be done so safely and not cause further incidents.  When vehicles vying for position are approaching a vehicle that has re-entered the track safely, but is not yet up to full speed, drivers are expected to exercise caution and patience until they are past the slower car or it is up to speed.  Damaged vehicles which are unable to maintain pace are to stay off the racing line while returning to the pits.</p>
            <p>All flags are to be obeyed, and lapped cars issued a blue flag must allow lapping car(s) to pass as soon as it is safe to do so. Conceding the inside lane heading into the next corner is recommended.</p>
            <p>Any incidents are to be reported within 24 hours of the event via private message over Discord to one of our Race Directors (stewards). Incidents reported will be reviewed and decisions communicated over the #incident-reports channel. Incidents not reported, yet spotted by stewards are subject for possible review. Criteria for a punishable offence will be:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Was the collision avoidable?</li>
                <li>Did the collision result in a loss of position(s), and / or substantial damage to the victim(s) requiring pit for repairs?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The penalty will be graduated depending on the severity of the offence:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Negative 1-10 Point Adjustment.</li>
                <li>Disqualification (all points gained from event removed)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>** No penalty issued will result in more points deducted than gained in the event.</p>
            <p>** Reverse grid position (in supported series) is based on total championship points, plus any penalty points incurred the previous race.</p>
            <p>Drivers who have multiple similar in nature and high severity offences within the series, at the discretion of the stewards, may be subject to more severe penalty, may be asked not to participate in the following race, or may be removed from the series.</p>
            <p>Decision by the stewards is final and cannot be appealed. Please demonstrate good sportsmanship, even if you do not agree.</p>
            <p>Any incidents which appear intentional, will be flagged for review by our Community Admins.</p>
            <p>We use Discord for our communications, and push to talk is required for events. Drivers are to assemble no later than, and be logged onto the server 15 minutes prior to <strong>qualification start</strong>. Please respect our admins by not speaking when they are making announcements. No talking during qualification and race sessions.</p>
            <p>When the race event is completed, please stay on the voice channel if you can and chat with our members. Our group first and foremost is about building camaraderie and having fun!</p>
